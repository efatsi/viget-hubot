# Hubot

This is a version of GitHub's Campfire bot, hubot. He's pretty cool.

**You'll probably never have to hack on this repo directly.**

Instead this repo provides a library that's distributed by `npm` that you
simply require in your project. Follow the instructions below and get your own
hubot ready to deploy.

## hubot-scripts

Hubot ships with a number of default scripts, but there's a growing number of
extras in the [hubot-scripts][hubot-scripts] repository. `hubot-scripts` is a
way to share scripts with the entire community.

Check out the [README][hubot-scripts-readme] for more help on installing
individual scripts.

When installing a new script make sure to add any of it's dependencies to package.json.

## HTTP Listener

Hubot has a HTTP listener which listens on the port specified by the `PORT`
environment variable.

You can specify routes to listen on in your scripts by using the `router`
property on `robot`.

```coffeescript
module.exports = (robot) ->
  robot.router.get "/hubot/version", (req, res) ->
    res.end robot.version
```

There are functions for GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, which all take a route and
callback function that accepts a request and a response.

## Testing hubot locally

Install all of the required dependencies by running `npm install`.

It's easy to test scripts locally with an interactive shell:

    % export PATH="node_modules/.bin:$PATH"
    % bin/hubot

... and to run unit tests:

    % make test
